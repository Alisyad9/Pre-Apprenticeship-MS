# Brief

**Mobile colour scheme generator**

We would ask you to create a colour scheme generator optimised for mobile devices inspired by [https://coolors.co/](https://coolors.co/)

**Base functionality:**

- Display a list of colours randomly generated by the app
- Allow the user to change the colour of each row individually (up to you to pick the best way for the user to change a colour on mobile)
- Share colour set (to yourself for example)

**Wishlist:**

- Shake for random colour set
- Save the last colour set across sessions
- Drag and drop row position
- Feel free to play and add anything you feel is appropriate! Show off your skills.

**Requirements:**

- You are free to use any kind of set up you like, vanilla JS, react, vue etc.
- It’s enough to optimise for either iOS or Android depending on what is available to you, but it should be mobile first.
- At the end please share a Bitbucket or Github repo and if possible, a link to a deployed version, [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is very easy to deploy static sites to.
